A little Christmas Card for Secret Santa and some kind requests on this repo:)

This is one of my first html projects as I did not come from a computer Science background. Learnt a lot about positioning (if you open it in web it will look super off haha). THese are moments that make you think how those 'transformation' of geometry classes in middle school were actually very useful - a.k.a. animations!

My recipient is in their data loving journey, discovering his yearly PowerBI skills! I missed out on making a data lake, decision tree, or random forest, so I dialed the puns down to the data forest hike and 'Snowflake' falling - it is our data standard for PowerBI after all! 

My slow vacation internet did not give me a great chance to test the lightened up music, but I had fun making cute animations and quick Figma designs. Next time, maybe I will try the code embedding, if I get better in Figma!

Until then, enjoy my wishes and puns!
